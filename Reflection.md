# Reflection

### Did you use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? If so, how?

Yes, I used AI tools, mainly ChatGPT, to help me debug setup issues, generate variations of text (copy), and speed up the creation of placeholder content. Besides ChatGPT, I also used Cursor IDE’s AI features, which made the coding process much faster thanks to its smart autocomplete and refactor tools. That allowed me to deliver a more complete system in less time than usual.

### What did you build or decide manually?

All the business logic, component structure, and architecture were designed manually by me. I chose Next.js with TypeScript for its powerful routing, built-in API support, and seamless integration with NextAuth, which made it easy to set up Google login and also add a fallback using email for lightweight authentication.

### Where did you need to think critically or make decisions beyond AI suggestions?

One of the key decisions was about defining the project scope, what features to include, and how to balance complexity with the limited time. I had to think through what would give the best experience and still keep things clean and maintainable.

### What would you improve with more time?

If I had more time, I’d definitely improve persistence. Instead of using localStorage, I’d set up a real database to store user profiles and links, enabling public sharing and better scalability. I’d also upgrade the authentication flow to include token-based validation and proper backend support for better security.
